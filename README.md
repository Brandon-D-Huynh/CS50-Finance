# CS50-Finance

This is my CS50 Finance project!

I was able to learn a lot about Flask and interactions with APIs from this project. I've actually been playing around with stocks since my freshman year of college, so it was actually a whole lot of fun working on this project.

I still need to work on some styling, but the program definitely works, and I'm really happy with it.

At this point I'm still new to coding and I've been dragging my feet a little bit, but I'm glad I was able to make something like this!
